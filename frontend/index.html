            <h2>Ever wonder how much food is wasted?</h2>
            <p class="statistic">In India, an estimated 40% of all food produced is wasted—enough to feed millions every single day.</p>
            <p>This isn't just about expired products; it's about perfectly good, nutritious meals from restaurants, events, and hotels that end up in landfills simply due to logistical challenges. We built Anna Setu to solve that problem.</p>

            <h2>The Bridge Between Waste and Want</h2>
            <p>Anna Setu—meaning "Food Bridge"—was created to solve this logistical challenge. We go beyond just feeding people by recognizing that all surplus food has value. Our platform provides a seamless and transparent way to donate food for human consumption, provide feed for animal shelters, or contribute to a greener planet through our composting program. We ensure that good food nourishes people, animals, and the earth—not landfills.</p>

                    <p>Using a simple form on their dashboard, a donor provides details about their surplus food—whether it's fresh meals, groceries, or items for compost—and sets a pickup time.</p>

                    <p>The volunteer picks up the donation, performs a quick quality check to ensure safety, and delivers it directly to a registered NGO, shelter, or community kitchen in need.</p>

# Anna Setu - Food Donation Platform

Anna Setu is a full-stack web application designed to bridge the gap between food donors and community receivers. It provides a comprehensive platform for managing the entire food rescue lifecycle, coordinated by administrators and facilitated by a network of dedicated volunteers.

## ‚ú® Core Features

The platform is built around four key user roles, each with a tailored dashboard and specific functionalities.

### üçΩÔ∏è Donors
* **Two Donor Types:** Supports both one-time **Instant Donors** and recurring **Regular Donors** (like restaurants or hotels).
* **Schedule Pickups:** Donors can easily schedule a pickup for surplus food, specifying the type (for humans, animals, or compost), quantity, and pickup instructions.
* **Track History:** A dedicated dashboard allows donors to view the status of their donations and see which volunteer has been assigned.

### üöö Volunteers
* **Task Management:** Volunteers have a dashboard to view and accept available delivery tasks.
* **Status Updates:** They can update the status of a task in real-time (Accepted, Picked Up, Delivered).
* **Quality Control:** A mandatory quality check form appears upon pickup, allowing volunteers to report on the food's condition and packaging.
* **Training Hub:** An in-app training section provides essential guidelines on food safety and etiquette.

### üè† Receivers
* **Post Needs:** Verified organizations (like NGOs and shelters) can post requests for specific food items they need.
* **Track Deliveries:** A dashboard shows them all upcoming deliveries that have been assigned to them.
* **Confirm Receipt:** They can confirm when a donation has been successfully received, completing the donation cycle.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Admins
* **Central Oversight:** A comprehensive dashboard with live statistics on users, donations, and platform activity.
* **User Verification:** Admins are responsible for approving or rejecting all new Regular Donors, Volunteers, and Receivers.
* **Logistics Coordination:** Admins assign pending donations to available volunteers for delivery to specific receivers.
* **Compost Management:** A dedicated section to manage compost-specific donations and log revenue from compost sales.

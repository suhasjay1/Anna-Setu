🍲 Anna Setu - Food Donation Platform

Anna Setu is a full-stack web application designed to bridge the gap between food donors and community receivers. It provides a comprehensive platform for managing the entire food rescue lifecycle, coordinated by administrators and facilitated by a network of dedicated volunteers.

✨ Core Features

The platform is built around four key user roles, each with a tailored dashboard and specific functionalities.

🍽️ Donors

Two Donor Types: Supports both one-time Instant Donors and recurring Regular Donors (restaurants, hotels, etc.).

Schedule Pickups: Donors can schedule a pickup for surplus food, specifying type (human, animal, or compost), quantity, and instructions.

Track History: A dashboard allows donors to view donation statuses and see the assigned volunteer.

🚚 Volunteers

Task Management: Dashboard to view and accept available delivery tasks.

Status Updates: Update task status in real time (Accepted → Picked Up → Delivered).

Quality Control: Mandatory quality check form upon pickup for food condition and packaging.

Training Hub: In-app training with essential food safety and etiquette guidelines.

🏠 Receivers

Post Needs: Verified NGOs/shelters can post requests for specific food items.

Track Deliveries: Dashboard shows upcoming deliveries assigned to them.

Confirm Receipt: Confirm when a donation is successfully received, completing the cycle.

⚙️ Admins

Central Oversight: Comprehensive dashboard with live statistics (users, donations, activity).

User Verification: Approve/reject new Regular Donors, Volunteers, and Receivers.

Logistics Coordination: Assign pending donations to volunteers for delivery to receivers.

Compost Management: Manage compost-specific donations and log revenue from compost sales.

🛠️ Technology Stack

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
